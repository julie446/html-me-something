    <h1>HTML Me Something</h1>
    <p><strong><em>This is my page for Launchcode. I don't like to cook (and I am a picky eater)
    but I can make a few things I like. Chai tea is especially good for relaxing
    on a cold day.</em></strong></p>

    <h2>Chai Tea</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Red Label Tea from Namaste India at 103rd and Metcalf</li>

            <li>ginger</li>
            <li>sugar</li>
