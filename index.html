    <h1>HTML Me Something</h1>
    <p>This is my page for Launchcode. I don't like to cook (and I am a picky eater)
    but I can make a few things I like. Chai tea is especially good for relaxing
    on a cold day.</p>

    <h2>Chai Tea</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Red Label Tea from Namaste India at 103rd & Metcalf</li>
            <li>milk (2% or skim)</li>
            <li>ginger</li>
            <li>sugar</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Remove the peel from the ginger and cut it into thin slices.
        Boil a little water and the ginger in a pan over medium heat.
        Add 2 teaspoons of Red Label Tea. Add one cup of milk.
        Bring back to boil. Strain the tea. Add one teaspoon sugar.</p>

        This video</a> explains how to seal the momos (starting at 3 minutes into the video).
        Then steam the momos until done.</p>
